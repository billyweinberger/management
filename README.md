# TODO - Update this to reflect new role, stay tuned :)

# Welcome to the Team!

## What is the purpose of this?

This is to introduce you to me, my values, and my working style.  

Managers serve their direct reports, and I am an avid supporter of "servant leadership," with that in mind my job, first and foremost, is to support you and enable you to be the best work version of yourself that you can be.

## My Values

1)	I always try to operate in good faith and I work under the assumption that others are as well.  I work under the assumption that we are all trying to do the right thing.

2) I will always be honest.  In the long term we are all better off when we are candid and honest with each other.

3) Mistakes are expected, failure is learning, as long as you grow from failure and learn from your mistakes you are moving in the right direction.  The differences between an associate engineer and a senior engineer or manager is that the latter have had a lot more opportunities to fail, make mistakes, and learn from them.

4) Self-care is of the utmost importance for every individual.  Take care of yourself, and if there is ever anything you need from me or the company in that regard please do not hesitate to reach out.

## Availability

1) I always try to respect work hours.  I will do my absolute best to not bother you on nights, weekends, and time off.

2) I will always go out of my way to make myself available for you.  I will do my best to keep my calendar up to date.  If you cannot find time on my calendar, reach out to me, I will make time.

## Communicating

1) If I send you an email or message after hours, do not feel obligated to respond until the next work day, unless otherwise noted.

2) I may reach out to you via Teams chat, or via phone call through Teams.  Anytime I send you a Teams message do not feel obligated to drop everything and respond right away.  If I need to speak to you urgently I will call.

3) Regarding calls, do not worry if you are away from your desk and I call.  I am a proponent of getting up from your work space frequently, clearing your head, stretching, walking, and doing whatever you need to do to take care of yourself.  If you miss a call from me during work hours, call me back at your convenience.

4) I love working session, I love jumping on group calls to work a problem out.  If we get too deep into a rabbit hole while figuring out a tech issue, let's jump on a call and work it out together.

## Feedback

1) I believe all employees should be empowered and feel safe sharing feedback about both my performance and any other concerns they have regarding the team and the company.  You can always share concerns with me and I will always handle them with consideration.  If you ever don't feel safe sharing your concerns with me, please, reach out to Jena or Beth in PeopleOps, I support this course of action 100%, I never want to put anybody in a position where they feel uncomfortable.

## 1-1s

1) We will have weekly 1-1s
2) These meetings are YOUR time, and we can talk about anything that is on your mind

## Disagreement

1) We may disagree on things. That's ok.  I will always try to see things from your point of view, and I hope you can do the same for me

## Time Off

1) You get PTO, floating holidays, and your birthday off.  I encourage you to use these days.  

2) I take time off for illness.  I take time off for mental health.  I don't expect you to tell me why you are taking off, it is your time to take.

3) For planning purposes, up front notice for vacation and extended time off is preferred, but just do your best in this regard and I will always do my best to work with you

## Career Development

Never hesitate to talk to me about what you want out of your career.  Ultimately it is your career, but I am here to help in any way that I can.
